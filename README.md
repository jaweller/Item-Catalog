# Catalog Project
This is my catalog project submission for Udacity's Full Stack Nano-Degree program. The CSS for this file is a work in progress and most of it was
copied from the course material. This is a project that is supposed
to teach us how to add CRUD functionality into a web app, I decided to put
off the aesthetics of the website for now.
